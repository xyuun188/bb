# Profitability Execution Plan

Updated: 2026-11-09, Asia/Shanghai.

Status: ACTIVE. Profitability acceptance has not passed.

Repository: `G:\数字量化\bb`; remote application: `/data/bb/app`.

History through 2026-11-08 is archived at
`docs/archive/profitability-execution-plan-through-2026-11-08.md`. That file is
audit history only; current code, tests, and fresh runtime evidence override
anything written there.

## Current Decision

The trading loop is not silently stalled. New entries are blocked because the
governed profitability and independent-return gates are not satisfied. The
latest known model state before the primary-horizon rebuild was shadow-only,
with fee-after `profit_factor` below `1.0` and a negative lower confidence
bound. Do not force trades, shorten the primary horizon, mix horizons, or relax
the positive-LCB, profit-factor, disjoint-exam, or live-readiness gates to
manufacture entries.

## Primary-Horizon Training Contract

`services/ml_signal_training_contract.py` defines the 240-minute primary
prediction horizon and the `fit_primary_horizon_only` policy.

`services/ml_signal_service.py` now filters the training frame to the primary
horizon before decision-group partitioning, tail-policy derivation, model
fitting, walk-forward evaluation, and holdout evaluation. The standalone
`scripts/phase3_quant_api_service.py` applies the same rule and rejects a
training request that has no 240-minute rows.

Artifacts record `fitted_horizons`, `source_training_horizons`,
`source_horizon_sample_counts`, `unfitted_horizon_minutes`,
`training_horizon_policy`, and `mixed_horizon_fit_allowed=false`. Non-primary
horizons remain visible as diagnostics only and cannot contribute promotion
evidence.

This removes a real contamination path; it does not create profitability.

## Acceptance Gates

A model can influence paper or live routing only after all existing gates pass:

- Chronologically disjoint decision groups and labels.
- Walk-forward folds fitted independently on the primary horizon.
- Positive fee-after lower confidence bound.
- Fee-after profit factor above `1.0`.
- Stable leave-one-symbol-out and market-regime evidence.
- Authoritative OKX execution-cost and realized-return calibration.
- The independent promotion exam, with no reuse of development or holdout data.

Elapsed time alone does not clear these conditions. A valid result requires
fresh, mature, authoritative samples and a candidate that passes the gates.

## Current Workflow

1. Deploy the verified code and preserve the runtime environment.
2. Verify source integrity, runtime imports, model tunnels, OKX connectivity,
   paper trading, and the Dashboard.
3. Run a non-persisting training preflight with fresh source data.
4. Persist and rebuild the primary-horizon model only if the preflight is valid.
5. Recheck Go/No-Go, readiness, profit factor, lower bound, fold stability, and
   whether a paper canary is permitted.
6. Keep paper-only execution and live routing disabled until every gate passes.

## Evidence Policy

Do not delete databases, raw authoritative audit records, metric samples, or
`data/profitability_remediation/`. Generated cache directories are disposable.
Retired model names may remain in leak-check denylists; that is not evidence
that a retired service is active.

## Current Limitation

There is no defensible time-to-profit estimate. The system is ready to collect
more evidence, not proven profitable.

## Horizon Economics Finding (2026-11-09)

A read-only study of all four source horizons measured fee-after net return by
score quantile, using the same walk-forward split the gate uses.

| Horizon | Side | Top 5% mean | Top 5% LCB | Top 5% PF | Sample |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 5 min | long | -0.0496% | -0.2014% | 0.798 | 80 |
| 5 min | short | -0.1349% | -0.2046% | 0.193 | 80 |
| 15 min | long | -0.0501% | -0.2872% | 0.866 | 80 |
| 15 min | short | -0.1688% | -0.4478% | 0.691 | 80 |
| 60 min | long | -0.2772% | -0.4482% | 0.372 | 80 |
| 60 min | short | **+0.7092%** | -0.1777% | 2.366 | 80 |
| 240 min | long | -0.6678% | -1.4046% | 0.547 | 79 |
| 240 min | short | -0.6882% | -1.4621% | 0.617 | 79 |

The 60-minute short top-quantile bucket is the only combination with positive
mean fee-after return and profit factor above one. It still fails the gate:
the return lower confidence bound is negative, fold 4 turns negative, and
leave-one-symbol-out is negative for every excluded symbol. The 240-minute
primary horizon shows negative fee-after returns on both sides at every
quantile tested. No tested horizon, side, or quantile simultaneously passes
positive LCB, profit factor above one, and split stability.

The practical reading: execution cost (about 0.14% round trip) is comparable to
the smallest horizon's gross edge, and the primary 240-minute horizon has no
generalizing directional edge in the current sample. This is a strategy and
feature-evidence problem, not a gate-calibration problem; relaxing the LCB, PF,
or stability gates would only manufacture entries without proven edge.

### Go/No-Go Evidence Binding

`services/phase3_go_no_go.py` previously read profitability from the legacy
`local_ai_tools` bundle, so the audit could display a stale profit factor from a
different model. It now prefers `local_ml_profit_quality` (the current local ML
artifact), reads side-specific profit factor, return LCB, mean return, and
fallback/ walk-forward state, and blocks when those fields are missing instead
of silently falling back. `web_dashboard/api/system_audit.py` exposes the
artifact evidence plus `top-level live_ml_ready`, and
`services/model_training_registry.py` surfaces per-side metrics for the same
identity.

### Counterfactual Cost Sign

Negative shadow execution costs were investigated. They come from funding
payments that credit a position (for example, negative funding paid to longs),
and each observed negative-cost sample carries a real `funding_interval_minutes`
and `next_funding_time`. The sign is semantically correct and is not clamped;
the cost model remains `shadow_counterfactual_live_microstructure`.
